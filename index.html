                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We at BBALL-STATLINE have embarked on a mission to transform basketball statistics for sports journalists, BBall influencers, and basketball enthusiasts from the traditional table format into a visual, responsive, and interactive live experience â€“ all at a glance!</p>
                <p>Our project is rooted in:</p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>Our love for basketball as NBA fans</li>
                    <li>Our innovation-driven skills in the field of Data Science in the Master's program in Business Informatics</li>
                    <li>The goal of developing a contemporary, modern approach to statistical information for the basketball fanbase</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- <p>1. Our love for basketball as NBA fans</p>
                <p>2. Our innovation-driven skills in the field of Data Science in the Master's program in Business Informatics</p> -->
                <p> </p>
                <p>Since the founding of the NBA almost 80 years ago, game, player, and season statistics in tabular form have served as an international foundation for sports journalists and fans. Starting with the 2023/24 season, enthusiasts can look forward to a contemporary, innovative facelift and interactive visualizations for player facts and analyses.</p>
                <p>At BBALL-STATLINE, we have developed a unique digital tool that, based on statistical values, provides an overview of the retrospective and current status of every player from the last 43 years (starting from the 1980 season) at a glance, and with a click, offers interactive connections and contextual analysis.</p>
                <p>By integrating percentiles, our application allows users to quickly grasp distribution characteristics within a specific season, enabling informed decisions and uncovering hidden trends that are often obscured by previous, commonly accessible statistics.</p>
                <p>With a focus on a streamlined user-centered design - coupled with relevant statistical information - we inspire the BBall community and also reach out to influencers and fans who follow the sport with less affinity for numbers.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, our aim is to provide a basketball experience that allows the community to easily and intuitively grasp the intricacies of each player - linked with easily digestible season statistics.</p>
                <p>Inspired by thought leaders like Ben Taylor from "Thinking Basketball" and motivated by the longstanding journalistic work of Dre Voigt ("Got Nexxt" magazine, podcaster, and more), Julius Schubert ("Just A Kid From Germany" on YouTube and more), and Jonathan Walker ("Jeden Tag NBA" podcast and more), we have launched an ambitious project over the past year with groundbreaking results. Currently, it is in the pilot phase as a desktop version and will be launched for the 2023/24 season.</p>
                <p>Currently, we are working onexpanding the content of our platform to cover an even broader spectrum of datasets and visualizations, including game statistics.</p>
                <p>BBALL-STATLINE aims to be a key player in the league of basketball statistics, and we look forward to our shared journey!</p>
